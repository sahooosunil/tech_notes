11. What are init levels or run-levels in linux operating system?
init-level or run levels indicates how we wanted the linux operating system to be booted. There are total 7 run levels are there from 0 - 6, to boot the linux operating system in a specific run-level or init level we need to use a command "init" followed by run-level
sudo init runLevel

1. sudo init 0 = shutdown / poweroff
2. sudo init 1 = single user-mode with no networking, no multi-tasking and only root access (its same as safe-mode in windows)
3. sudo init 2 = with networking and multi-tasking. no gui
4. sudo init 3 = supports networking, multi-tasking, no gui
5. sudo init 4 = same as init 3 level, but reserved for research purpose

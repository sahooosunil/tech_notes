How to install the software packages aspart of the ubuntu operating system?
The ubuntu operating system has provided #2 tools
1. apt  = advanced packaging tool is an package manager through which we can browse, search, download and install the packaged software from the repositories

2. dpkg = debain package manager is an installer through which we can install the .deb file that is download onto the operating system


How does the apt tool knows the information/address location of an software repository?
The location/address of the software repositories are stored in ubuntu operating system under the filesystem location of /etc/apt/sources.list file or under /etc/apt/system.d/ directory

what is the format in which the software repositories are added in the /etc/apt/sources.list
deb [arch=cpuArch] repositoryURL version category

How to add an software repository into the ubuntu operating system?
There are 2 ways are there
1. we can manually edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file using the text editor like nano or vim and need to add an new entry into the file in the specific format

2. instead of adding the new repository entry manually into the file, which could lead to syntax errors, we can use apt-add-repository tool for adding the new repository

sudo apt-add-repository reposityURL

How to ensure the communication between the linux machine through apt tool to the software repositories are secured?
To ensure secured communication between the client machine using apt tool and the ubuntu software repositories, the gpg keys (gnu privacy guard)	are introduced. these are public/private encryption keys through which all the communication that takes place between the repository server and the client machine are encrypted/decrypted for security

The gpg key is distributed by the repository vendor, we should install the key on to the local machine before communicating with the remote repository

1. then create a keyrings directory
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

2. downloading the gpg key and write to a file
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
	
3. grant read permission for all the users of the linux machine
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg


4. now add the repository into the source.list file by referring the above download key
deb [arch="amd64" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu jammy Main


after adding the repository URL to the sources.list or sources.list.d/ directory we need to update the local cache of the repository with latest entries by running
sudo apt update -y
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are lot of commands provided aspart of apt tool for browsing, searching and installing the software packages onto the ubuntu operating system machine

1. sudo apt update -y = updates the local repository cache with the new entries from the remote repositories
2. sudo apt install packageName = to install a software package onto the machine, it ask for confirmation before installing. if you want an non-interactive installing use -y option
3. sudo apt upgrade = it checks for the new versions of the installed software packages are available, if available then upgrades all of them to the latest
4. sudo apt search packageName = we can search for an specific software package using apt search
5. sudo apt list --upgradable = show the list of software packages for which the latest verions are available to be upgraded on the machine
6. sudo apt upgrade packageName = will upgrade a specified package to the latest if available
7. sudo apt remove packageName = will uninstall the software package that has been installed on the machine. but may not cleanup the configuration files and the download software package file
8. sudo apt purge packageName = will uninstall the software package along with the configuration files that has been created during the install including the .deb file that has been downloaded and cached locally
9. sudo apt autoremove = removes the unused software packages or libraries from the machine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In older version of ubuntu there are 2 package manager tools are there and there is no apt tool available
	1. apt-cache = refreshing the software package repository
	2. apt-get = installing, upgrading the software packages on the machine

the people using the ubuntu operating system find it complex in using these 2 tools and they should know when to use which tool. so in the latest version of the ubuntu operating system, these 2 tools are merged into one with all the common features of them as apt tool

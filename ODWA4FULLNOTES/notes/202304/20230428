How does the default permissions to a File/Folder will be assigned by the linux operating system upon creating a File/Folder?
The user dont need to explicitly set the File/Folder permissions while creating them, since it is an tedious job for setting the permissions for every File/Folder we create. Most of the time we wanted to create a File/Folder with same permissions across, setting the same permissions manually doesnt makes sense.
	
Thats where linux operating system computes the File/Folder permissions from an special variable called umask. The umask variable will be available per each user of the linux operating system.
	
The default umask variable value
For root user = 0022
For normal user = 0002
	
The default max permissions allowed
On a File in Linux operating system is = 666. Because the execute permission on a File will not be granted by default for security
On a Folder the max permission = 777, we should be able to change directory (cd) 
	
For eg.. the greg umask = 0022
Now greg is creating an File
touch technobytes.txt, now linux will compute the default permissions for this file as below
max permission file = 666
	                 - 0002
	                  ------
	                   0664  = (rw-rw-r--) default permission
	                  ------
										
For e.g.. bob has created an directory
mkdir trips
max default permission for a folder = 777
	                                 - 0002
	                                ---------
	                                   0775  = rwxrwxr-x (default permission)
	
How to know what is the umask value of a user?
we need to run the umask command that displays the umask value for that user
umask


we can change the default permissions being assigned while creating a file/folder for a user by changing the default umask value for that user
umask 0ownergroupothers
first '0' = indicates its an octal number


when we change the umask variable value for a user, it will be temporary upon restart/relogin into the terminal/operating system the umask value will be reset to the default
	
How to permanently change the umask value for an user?
add an entry into ~/.bashrc file as shown below to permanently change the umask value

vim ~/.bashrc
goto the end of the file shift+g 

umask 0026
then save and quite

The above umask variable value will be applied for the user for whom we have changed

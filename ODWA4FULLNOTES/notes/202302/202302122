How does devops helps us in fast-paced application development and delivery?
Devops recommends us to change the culture and adopt new tools & technologies across the stages of development to delivery of the application to achieve fast-paced development and delivery
during the time of development, there are bunch new tools and technologies to be adopted and change in the culture in building the application as described below:
1. understand the requirements
2. choose the programming language
3. setup the development environment
	3.1 use virtualization for creating an isolated development environment
	3.2 use vagrant for automating the process of creating the virtual machine
4. choose the process model for development and delivery of the application
devops recommends us to use agile based scrum methodology for faster-development and rapid delivery of the application. 
5. use an sourcecode management repository for collaborative application development
devops recommends us to use GIT repository, since it is
	1. distributed sourcecode management repository
	2. it supports better branching strategy when compared with other repository management systems
6. during the time of development, the developer has to conduct the unit testing before delivery of the application
devops strongly recommends to use Test driven development (TDD) approach and use unit test automation frameworks for conducting the unittesting for an software application

In addition to automation testing, we need to use tools for verifying the coverage like
test report = to see how many tests are passed and failed using sure-fire tool
test coverage tool = to see what percentage of code has been tested using the test automation using jacoco, cobertura and emma

In addition the developer has to use static code analysis tools for code review like sonarcube

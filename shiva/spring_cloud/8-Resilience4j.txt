### Resilience4j: Key Design Patterns and Configuration

**Resilience4j** is a lightweight library designed to help you build resilient and fault-tolerant microservices. It implements several important design patterns:

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
   - Protects your system by preventing repeated attempts to call a failing service, which could lead to system degradation or crashes.
   
2. **Bulkhead Pattern**:
   - Isolates different parts of the system to prevent a failure in one part from cascading and affecting the entire system.

3. **Rate Limiter Pattern**:
   - Controls the rate at which requests are sent to a service, preventing it from being overwhelmed.

4. **Retry Pattern**:
   - Automatically retries failed requests, with configurable delays and retry limits.

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern Explained:

- **Problem**: If one service is down or responding slowly, services that depend on it (in a service chain) can also fail, potentially bringing down the entire system.
- **Solution**: Use a circuit breaker to monitor the health of a service and prevent further calls to a failing service, instead triggering fallback logic.

For example:
- **Service A** calls **Service B**.
- If **Service B** is down or slow, **Service A** will experience delays, leading to poor performance.
- The **Circuit Breaker** detects the issue and opens the circuit, preventing further calls from **A** to **B**.
- When the circuit is open, **Service A** will immediately execute its fallback logic instead of waiting for **B**. (because anyway the call will fail, so no use of waiting)

#### Circuit Breaker States:
1. **Closed**: 
   - All requests go through.
   - The circuit breaker monitors the success/failure ratio.
   
2. **Open**: 
   - Requests are blocked to prevent strain on the failing service.
   - Fallback logic is executed immediately.
   
3. **Half-Open**: 
   - A limited number of test requests are sent to the service.
   - If successful, the circuit closes; if failures persist, it reopens.

#### Example Configuration (`application.yml`):

```yaml
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    instances:
      routingservice:
        minimum-number-of-calls: 5
        failure-rate-threshold: 50
        wait-duration-in-open-state: 30000
        permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state: 2
    configs:
      default:
        register-health-indicator: true
```

#### Configuration Breakdown:

1. **Minimum Number of Calls**:
   - The circuit breaker starts monitoring after 5 calls (`minimum-number-of-calls: 5`).

2. **Failure Rate Threshold**:
   - If 50% of the calls fail (`failure-rate-threshold: 50`), the circuit transitions to the **Open** state.

3. **Wait Duration in Open State**:
   - The circuit stays open for 30 seconds (`wait-duration-in-open-state: 30000`), during which no requests are sent to the failing service.

4. **Permitted Calls in Half-Open State**:
   - After the wait duration, the circuit transitions to **Half-Open** and allows 2 test calls (`permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state: 2`).

5. **Half-Open State Behavior**:
   - If both test calls fail, the circuit transitions back to **Open**.
   - If successful, the circuit transitions back to **Closed**.

#### How It Works:

1. **Monitoring**:
   - The circuit breaker tracks service call outcomes.
   
2. **Opening the Circuit**:
   - If failure rate exceeds the threshold (e.g., 3 out of 5 calls fail), the circuit opens, blocking further calls.

3. **Reevaluation**:
   - After the open state duration, the system tests the service with limited calls.
   
4. **Decision**:
   - Based on the test results, the circuit either reopens or fully closes.

By implementing **Resilience4j** and configuring it as shown, you can ensure your services handle failures gracefully, improving the overall reliability and performance of your system.

### Steps to Configure Circuit Breaker Using Resilience4j

**1. Add the Dependency:**
Include the Resilience4j circuit breaker starter in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-resilience4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**2. Create an Interface:**
Define the interface for the service you want to protect with a circuit breaker.

```java
public interface CargoRoutingService {
    TransitPath findOptimalRoute(String originUnLocode, String destinationUnLocode, String deadline);
}
```

**3. Implement the Interface:**
Create a class that implements the interface and annotate the method with `@CircuitBreaker`.

```java
@Service
public class CargoRoutingServiceImpl implements CargoRoutingService {

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @CircuitBreaker(name = "routingservice", fallbackMethod = "findOptimalRouteFallback")
    public TransitPath findOptimalRoute(String originUnLocode, String destinationUnLocode, String deadline) {
        final String REST_URI = "http://localhost:8082/cargorouting/optimalRoute?origin={origin}&destination={destination}&deadline={deadline}";
        System.err.println("CargoRoutingServiceImpl.findOptimalRoute() - Calling Cargo Routing Service");

        return restTemplate.getForObject(REST_URI, TransitPath.class, originUnLocode, destinationUnLocode, deadline);
    }

    public TransitPath findOptimalRouteFallback(String originUnLocode, String destinationUnLocode, String deadline, Throwable t) {
        System.err.println("CargoRoutingServiceImpl.findOptimalRouteFallback() - Fallback Logic Triggered");
        return new TransitPath(); // Return a default or alternative response
    }
}
```

**4. Calling the Circuit Breaker Method:**
Use the service in another class by injecting it and invoking the method.

```java
@Service
public class ExternalCargoRoutingService {

    @Autowired
    private CargoRoutingService cargoRoutingService;

    public CargoItinerary fetchRouteForSpecification(RouteSpecification routeSpecification) {
        System.out.println("ExternalCargoRoutingService.fetchRouteForSpecification() - Fetching Route");

        TransitPath transitPath = cargoRoutingService.findOptimalRoute(
            routeSpecification.getOrigin().getUnLocCode(),
            routeSpecification.getDestination().getUnLocCode(),
            routeSpecification.getArrivalDeadline().toString()
        );

        return toCargoItinerary(transitPath);
    }
}
```

**5. Add Configuration in `application.yml`:**
Configure Resilience4j for the circuit breaker.

```yaml
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    instances:
      routingservice: # This name matches the one in @CircuitBreaker(name = "routingservice")
        minimum-number-of-calls: 5
        failure-rate-threshold: 50
        wait-duration-in-open-state: 30000
        permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state: 2
    configs:
      default:
        register-health-indicator: true # to see circuit breaker logs/calls/state using actuator endpoint
```

### Explanation:

1. **Dependency Injection with AOP:**
   - When `@Autowired private CargoRoutingService cargoRoutingService;` is used, Spring creates a proxy object for `CargoRoutingServiceImpl` using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).
   - This proxy manages the circuit breaker logic.

2. **Method Invocation Flow:**
   - When `findOptimalRoute()` is called, the proxy checks the circuit breaker status.
   - If the circuit is **closed**, the original method (`findOptimalRoute()`) is invoked.
   - If the method call fails (e.g., returns a 500 error), the circuit breaker triggers the fallback method (`findOptimalRouteFallback`).

3. **Circuit Breaker Behavior:**
   - The circuit breaker monitors the number of calls and failure rate.
   - If failures exceed the threshold, the circuit opens, and subsequent calls directly invoke the fallback logic without attempting the original method.

By following these steps, you can effectively use Resilience4j to enhance the resilience of your services with circuit breaker functionality.
You can see circuit breaker logs/calls/state using actuator endpoint. you have to enabale spring boot actuator endpoints

### Bulkhead Pattern in Microservices with Threads Concept

The **Bulkhead Pattern** is a resilience pattern used in microservices to isolate failures and prevent a single component failure from cascading and affecting the entire system. It is analogous to compartments in a ship, where each compartment can be sealed off to prevent flooding from spreading.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Isolation**:
   - The pattern isolates different parts of the system, often by dividing resources like thread pools, to ensure that failures in one part don’t affect others.
   
2. **Thread Pools**:
   - In microservices, the bulkhead pattern is implemented using separate thread pools for different tasks or service calls.
   - Each service or operation has its own thread pool. If one service is overwhelmed or fails, it only affects its thread pool, preventing a thread starvation scenario where other services can't get resources.

#### How It Works:

- **Service Isolation**:
  - Suppose you have multiple microservices: `Service A`, `Service B`, and `Service C`.
  - `Service A` handles critical operations, while `Service B` and `Service C` handle less critical ones.
  - To implement the bulkhead pattern, you assign separate thread pools for each service.

- **Example Scenario**:
  - `Service A` has a dedicated thread pool of 10 threads.
  - `Service B` and `Service C` also have their own thread pools, say 5 threads each.
  - If `Service B` experiences a spike in traffic or a slowdown, only its 5 threads will be occupied. Other services (`Service A` and `Service C`) will remain unaffected and continue to process their tasks with their dedicated thread pools.

#### Benefits:

1. **Fault Isolation**:
   - If one service or operation fails or becomes slow, it doesn't exhaust the shared resources (like threads), ensuring other services can continue to function normally.

2. **Improved Resilience**:
   - By isolating failures, the system as a whole becomes more resilient. Only the failing service or component is impacted, while others remain operational.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Resources are allocated efficiently and fairly among services. No single service can monopolize the resources, leading to better stability and performance.

#### Example in Microservices with Resilience4j:

In **Resilience4j**, the bulkhead pattern can be implemented by configuring thread pools for each service or method call.

```yaml
resilience4j:
  bulkhead:
    instances:
      serviceA:
        max-concurrent-calls: 10 # Maximum threads for Service A
        max-wait-duration: 500ms # Max wait time if threads are busy
      serviceB:
        max-concurrent-calls: 5  # Maximum threads for Service B
        max-wait-duration: 300ms # Max wait time if threads are busy
```

- **`max-concurrent-calls`**: Defines the maximum number of concurrent calls (threads) allowed for a service.
- **`max-wait-duration`**: Specifies how long a request will wait if all threads are busy before it gets rejected.

#### Summary:

The Bulkhead Pattern in microservices ensures that failures or high loads in one service don’t cascade to others by isolating resources using separate thread pools.
This allows the system to degrade gracefully rather than fail completely, ensuring better reliability and user experience.
----------------------
### Steps to Configure Bulkhead Pattern Using Resilience4j

#### 1. Add the Dependency:
Include the Resilience4j circuit breaker starter in your `pom.xml` to enable the necessary components:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-resilience4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### 2. Define the Service Interface:
Create an interface for the service that will use the bulkhead pattern:

```java
public interface CargoRoutingService {
    CompletableFuture<TransitPath> findOptimalRoute(String originUnLocode, String destinationUnLocode, String deadline);
}
```

#### 3. Implement the Service with Bulkhead:

```java
@Service
public class CargoRoutingServiceImpl implements CargoRoutingService {

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Bulkhead(name = "rsbh", fallbackMethod = "findOptimalRouteFallback", type = Bulkhead.Type.THREADPOOL)
    public CompletableFuture<TransitPath> findOptimalRoute(String originUnLocode, String destinationUnLocode, String deadline) {
        final String REST_URI = "http://localhost:8082/cargorouting/optimalRoute?origin={origin}&destination={destination}&deadline={deadline}";

        System.err.println("CargoRoutingServiceImpl.findOptimalRoute() - Hitting cargo routing service");

        // Simulating network delay
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }

        TransitPath transitPath = restTemplate.getForObject(REST_URI, TransitPath.class, originUnLocode, destinationUnLocode, deadline);
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(transitPath);
    }

    public CompletableFuture<TransitPath> findOptimalRouteFallback(String originUnLocode, String destinationUnLocode, String deadline, Throwable t) {
        System.err.println("CargoRoutingServiceImpl.findOptimalRouteFallback() - Executing fallback logic");
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(new TransitPath());
    }
}
```

#### 4. Configure Resilience4j in `application.yml`:

```yaml
resilience4j:
  bulkhead: 
    instances:
      rsbh:
        max-concurrent-calls: 10 # This will be ignored when using THREADPOOL bulkhead
        max-wait-duration: 500ms # This will also be ignored

  thread-pool-bulkhead:
    instances:
      rsbh: # Matches the name used in @Bulkhead annotation
        core-thread-pool-size: 1          # Core number of threads
        max-thread-pool-size: 1           # Maximum number of threads
        queue-capacity: 1                 # Size of the queue
        keep-alive-duration: 2s           # Time to keep idle threads alive
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Thread Pool Bulkhead**: 
   - **`core-thread-pool-size`**: The core number of threads always kept alive.
   - **`max-thread-pool-size`**: The maximum number of threads allowed in the pool.
   - **`queue-capacity`**: The capacity of the queue to hold tasks before rejecting them.
   - **`keep-alive-duration`**: The time threads above the core size are kept alive before being terminated if idle.

2. **Fallback Method**:
   - The `findOptimalRouteFallback` method provides a default response when the main method fails due to thread pool exhaustion or other exceptions.

3. **Behavior**:
   - When `findOptimalRoute` is called, Resilience4j's bulkhead limits the number of concurrent threads accessing the service.
   - If all threads and the queue are full, new requests are immediately sent to the fallback method, preventing the system from overloading.

This setup ensures that the service remains responsive under high load by limiting the number of concurrent requests and providing graceful degradation through fallback logic.

### **Difference between NoSQL and SQL:**  

| **Criteria**       | **SQL (Relational Databases)**               | **NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)**                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure** | Structured tables with rows and columns      | Flexible schemas like key-value, document, graph, or column-family |
| **Schema**         | Fixed schema (strictly defined tables)       | Dynamic schema (easily adaptable)                    |
| **Scalability**    | Vertical scaling (adding more resources to the server) | Horizontal scaling (adding more servers)            |
| **Query Language** | Structured Query Language (SQL)              | No standardized query language (varies by database)   |
| **Transactions**   | Strong ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Eventual consistency, some provide BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) |
| **Examples**       | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server     | MongoDB (Document), Redis (Key-Value), Neo4j (Graph), Cassandra (Column-Family) |
| **Use Case**       | Complex queries, joins, and transactions     | Flexible data models, high scalability, real-time data processing |

### **When to Choose SQL:**  
1. **Complex Queries and Transactions:** If you need complex joins, multi-row transactions, or strong ACID compliance.  
2. **Structured Data:** When data is highly structured with well-defined relationships.  
3. **Legacy Systems:** If you're working with systems that are already using relational databases.  
4. **Data Integrity and Security:** When data integrity and security are a high priority (e.g., banking systems).  
5. **Examples of Use Cases:** Financial applications, e-commerce systems, inventory management.

### **When to Choose NoSQL:**  
1. **High Scalability and Performance:** For handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.  
2. **Dynamic Schema:** When data models are evolving or require frequent changes.  
3. **Big Data and Real-Time Analytics:** For real-time processing of big data (e.g., IoT, social media analytics).  
4. **Distributed Architecture:** When horizontal scaling is a priority (e.g., microservices architecture).  
5. **Examples of Use Cases:** Content management systems, social networks, chat applications, big data analytics.

### **Summary:**  
- **SQL** is ideal for structured data with complex relationships and transactions.  
- **NoSQL** is better for large-scale, distributed systems requiring flexible schemas and high performance.

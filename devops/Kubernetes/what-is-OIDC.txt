OIDC stands for **OpenID Connect**. It's a way to **prove who you are** when you try to access a website or an application. 
Think of it like showing an ID card to get into a secure building.

### Real-World Example:

Imagine you’re trying to enter a high-security office building:
1. **Receptionist** asks for your ID.
2. You **show your ID** (like a driver's license) that proves who you are.
3. The **receptionist checks** your ID to see if it's valid.
4. If everything is okay, you’re **allowed in**.

### OIDC in the Digital World:

In the digital world, the process is similar but involves websites and apps:

1. **You** want to access an online service (e.g., a cloud dashboard).
2. The service asks, **"Who are you?"**
3. Instead of entering a username and password, you choose to **log in with Google** (or another identity provider).
4. You are redirected to Google, where you **prove who you are** by logging in.
5. **Google checks** your identity and, if valid, gives you a **token** (like a digital ID card).
6. You take this token back to the service.
7. The service **verifies** the token with Google to ensure it's real.
8. If the token is valid, you’re **allowed in**.

### Key Points:
- **OIDC** is built on top of OAuth 2.0, but it’s mainly about identity (proving who you are).
- The **token** is called an **ID Token**, which has information about you (like name, email, etc.).
- It’s **secure** because your password is never shared with the app, only the token is.

---

### Example Flow:
- You open an app and click **"Login with Google"**.
- You’re redirected to Google to enter your credentials.
- Google verifies you and gives an **ID Token** to the app.
- The app checks the token and lets you in, knowing who you are.

### Why Use OIDC?
- **Convenience:** No need to remember separate passwords for every app.
- **Security:** Your credentials stay with the identity provider (like Google).
- **Consistency:** Works across multiple apps and platforms.

### How EKS Uses OIDC:
In EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):
- OIDC helps map **Kubernetes service accounts** to **IAM roles** securely.
- It lets a pod **prove its identity** to access AWS resources without using static keys.

For example:
- A pod in EKS wants to access an S3 bucket.
- It uses OIDC to prove its identity using an associated IAM role.
- The IAM role grants the necessary permissions, and the pod can access S3 securely.

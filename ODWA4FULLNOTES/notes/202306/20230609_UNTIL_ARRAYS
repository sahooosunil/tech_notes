Arrays
Arrays are contigeous memory locations in which we can store identical dataType values, so that those can be accessed through index and perform operation on those values easily.
	
Arrays are also called as indexed collections, because we collect group of values and access them based on memory indexes. Always the array index starts with 0 to n-1 if the number of elements are N

advantage/purpose:
we can apply the programming logic on the group of elements by iterating over them sequentially, so that we can avoid duplicating the code 

How to declare an array in shellscript?
There are 3 ways we can delcare arrays in shellscript programming

#1. while creating the array itself we can populate values into them as below
PRODUCT_PRICES=(300 350 500 450)
	
#2. Index declaration
PRODUCT_PRICES[0]=300
PRODUCT_PRICES[1]=350
PRODUCT_PRICES[2]=500
PRODUCT_PRICES[3]=450
	
#3. Array declaration
declare -a ARRAY_NM 
here -a indicates the variable as Array Type

here we declare a variable of empty array now we need to populate the data into the array using indexes
declare -a PRODUCT_PRICES
PRODUCT_PRICES[0]=300
PRODUCT_PRICES[1]=350
PRODUCT_PRICES[2]=500
PRODUCT_PRICES[3]=450

	
How to interactively read the data into arrays?
while reading the data itself we can store them in an array using -a option within read instruction as below.
	
read -p "Product Prices: " -a PRODUCT_PRICES
the above read statement prompt for values, we need to pass the values separated by space, so that all the values will taken and stored in PRODUCT_PRICES array

How to access elements from the Array?
	
1. How to access all the elements from the array?
${ARRAY_NM} = is the expression to refer an array
$VARIABLE_NM = variable expression

1.1 ${ARRAY_NM[@]}	
1.2 ${ARRAY_NM[*]}

2. How to find the number of elements in an Array?
${#ARRAY_NM[@]}	

3. How to access a specific index element in the Array?
${ARRAY_NM[INDEX]}	

#1. wap to print all the elements in an array?
traverseArray.sh
----------------
#!/bin/bash
N=(30 45 68 93 28)
	
There are 2 ways we can iterate over the above array elements and can display them
1. using for loop
2. while loop

using for loop:
for ELEM in ${N[@]}
do
	echo $ELEM
done

(or)
using while loop: counter based loops
LEN=${#N[@]}
I=0
while [ $I -lt $LEN ]	
do
	echo ${N[I]}
	I=$[I+1]
done

(or)
		
LEN=${#N[@]}
for((I=0;I<LEN;I++))
do
	echo ${N[I]}
done

wap to collect interactively the values into an array and find the biggest number and print it?
	
highestNumberInArray.sh
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Numbers: " -a N
BIG=0
	
for ELE in ${N[@]}	
do
	if [ $BIG -lt $ELE ]; then
		BIG=$ELE
	fi
done
echo $BIG
	
1. wap to find second highest number in the array?
2. wap to sum all the numbers in the array and print it?
3. wap to reverse the array elements and print it? 
4. wap to print odd numbers in the given array
5. wap to remove negative numbers in the array and return a new array
6. wap to sort the elements of the array and print them 74 72 9 34 => 9 34 72 74

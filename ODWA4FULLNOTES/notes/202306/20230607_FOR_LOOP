how many types of loop control statements are there?
There are 3 types of loop control statements are there
1. while
2. for
3. until

2. for loop
for loop is an loop control statement that is used for repeatedly executing a block of code over a fixed list of values. There are 2 forms of for loop are there
1. for loop over fixed list values
2. counter based for loop

1. for loop over fixed list values
we pass a list of items as an input to the for loop asking it loop through those values in performing operation on each item.
syntax:-
for VAR in item1 item2 item3 item4.. itemN
do
	statements
	statements
done

2. counter based for loops
we can repeatedly execute a block of code for fixed number of times by using counter based loops. In counter based loops we have #3 parts

1. counter variable initialization
2. condition
3. incrementation

I=0 // initialization
while [ $I -le 10 ] // condition
do
	I=$[I+1] // incrementation
done

we can write counter based loops using while, where we have counter variable initialized before the loop. then each iteration we check for condition and within the loop we increment the counter.
	
instead of using while loop we can use for loop also for implementing counter based loops 
syntax:-
	
for((initialization;condition;incrementation))	
do
	statements
done

1.wap to print the N given numbers from 1 to N

printNNumber.sh
----------------
#!/bin/bash
read -p "N : " N
for((I=1;I<N;I++))
do
	echo $I
done

wap to print sum of prime numbers between 1 to N
N = 10
2 3 5 7 = 17
	
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
	
I=3
SUM=5
	
printSumOfNPrimeNumbers.sh
--------------------------
#!/bin/bash
read -p "N :" N
SUM=0
for((I=2;I<=N;I++))
do
	IS_PRIME=0
	for((J=2;J<=I-1;J++)) //verify the I is prime or not
	do
		REM=$[I%J]
		if [ $REM -eq 0 ]; then
			IS_PRIME=1
			break
		fi		
	done
	if [ $IS_PRIME -eq 0 ]; then
		SUM=$[SUM+I]
	fi
done

echo "sum : $SUM"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
until loop
until is also an loop control statement which is used for repeatitively executing a block of code until the condition is false. if the condition given is true, it breaks the loop
so, an until loop is an reverse of while loop

syntax:-
until [ condition ]
do
	statements
done

here if the condition given is false, it enters into the loop and executes the block of code, if the condition is true, the loop will break
	
wap to print numbers sequential until user press (q) on the keyboard
printNNumbers.sh
#!/bin/bash
F="N"
I=1
	
until [ $F = "q" ]
do
		echo "$I"
		I=$[I+1]
		read -p "press (q) to quit: " F
done

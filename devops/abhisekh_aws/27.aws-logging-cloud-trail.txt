To track and audit who uploaded or deleted data in AWS S3, you can enable **AWS CloudTrail** logging. CloudTrail records API calls made to S3, which includes operations like uploading, deleting, and modifying objects.

Here’s how to set it up:

### 1. **Enable AWS CloudTrail**
   - **CloudTrail** captures all the API activities in your AWS environment, including S3 operations.
   - Go to the **CloudTrail** console: [AWS CloudTrail Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)
   - If it's not already enabled, click **Create trail** to set up logging for your AWS account.
   - Choose to apply it across all regions (recommended) to capture all actions.

### 2. **Configure CloudTrail to Log S3 Events**
   - Under the trail settings, ensure that **S3 data events** are logged. 
   - You can choose to log **Read events** (e.g., GetObject) and/or **Write events** (e.g., PutObject, DeleteObject).
   - You can also configure CloudTrail to send logs to an S3 bucket for persistent storage.

### 3. **View CloudTrail Logs**
   - After logging is enabled, CloudTrail will record details of the operations, including the **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** user who performed the action.
   - You can view the logs in the **CloudTrail console** or search using the **CloudTrail Event History**. 
   - In the logs, look for entries related to S3 actions. The log will include the following:
     - **EventName**: What action was performed (e.g., `PutObject`, `DeleteObject`)
     - **Username or IAM Role**: Who performed the action.
     - **Source IP**: From where the request came.
     - **Bucket Name**: The affected S3 bucket.
     - **Timestamp**: When the action was performed.

### 4. **Optional: Set up Amazon CloudWatch for Monitoring and Alerts**
   - For real-time monitoring, you can create **CloudWatch Alarms** based on CloudTrail logs to notify you whenever specific actions (like object deletions) happen in your S3 bucket.
   - You can use **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** to monitor your CloudTrail logs in near-real-time.

### Example: Look for a `DeleteObject` action in CloudTrail logs
1. Go to **CloudTrail** → **Event History**.
2. Filter by event name: `DeleteObject`.
3. Review the event details, which will include the IAM user/role that performed the deletion.

This process provides an audit trail for user actions, including upload, modification, and deletion events in S3, and it helps ensure compliance and security within your AWS environment.

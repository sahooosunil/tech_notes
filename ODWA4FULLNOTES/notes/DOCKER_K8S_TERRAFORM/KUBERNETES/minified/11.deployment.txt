## **Types of Controllers in Kubernetes**  
There are five main controllers in Kubernetes:  
1. **ReplicaSet**  
2. **Deployment**  
3. **DaemonSet**  
4. **Job**  
5. **Service**  

## **Deployment Controller**  
The Deployment Controller automates application deployment and updates in a Kubernetes cluster. Instead of manually managing deployments and version rollouts, it ensures controlled updates to pods.

**Example:**  
If a running application (v1) needs an update (v2), the Deployment Controller handles the rollout efficiently using different deployment strategies.

### **Deployment Strategies**  
Kubernetes supports five deployment strategies:  
1. **Recreate** – Deletes old pods before creating new ones (causes downtime).  
2. **Rolling Update (Ramped)** – Updates pods gradually, minimizing downtime.  
3. **Blue/Green** – Runs both old and new versions, switching traffic after testing.  
4. **Canary** – Releases a small percentage of new versions before full rollout.  
5. **A/B Testing** – Routes traffic based on conditions for controlled testing.  

### **Recreate Strategy**  
- Deletes all existing pods before deploying new ones.  
- Causes downtime; best for development environments.  
- Suitable when shared volumes prevent concurrent versions.  

#### **Advantages:**  
✔ Fast rollout in one step  
✔ No additional infrastructure required  

#### **Disadvantages:**  
✘ Not suitable for production (downtime)  

#### **Deployment Example (Recreate Strategy)**  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sailordeployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        appName: sailor
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: sailor
          image: techsriman/sailor:1.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```
Create the deployment:  
```bash
kubectl create -f sailor-deployment.yml
```

#### **Viewing Deployment Details**  
```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl describe deployment <deploymentName>
```

#### **Updating the Application Version**  
```bash
kubectl set image deployment/sailordeployment container=techsriman/sailor:2.0
```
or edit manually:  
```bash
kubectl edit deployment sailordeployment
```

#### **Viewing and Rolling Back Deployment Versions**  
```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/sailordeployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/sailordeployment --to-revision=1
```

#### **Pausing and Resuming Deployments**  
```bash
kubectl rollout pause deployment/sailordeployment
kubectl rollout resume deployment/sailordeployment
```

#### **Scaling Deployments**  
```bash
kubectl scale deployment/sailordeployment --replicas=4
```

---

## **Rolling Update Strategy (Ramped)**  
- Gradually updates pods one by one.  
- Ensures zero downtime.  
- Uses readiness probes to ensure new pods are ready before deleting old ones.  

#### **Example Deployment (Rolling Update Strategy)**  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sailordeployment
spec:
  replicas: 5
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 2  # Max new pods at a time
      maxUnavailable: 0  # Ensures availability
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        appName: sailor
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: sailor
          image: techsriman/sailor:2.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

---

## **Blue/Green Deployment**  
- Runs both old (Blue) and new (Green) versions in parallel.  
- Traffic is switched to the new version after testing.  
- Instant rollback if needed.  

#### **Advantages:**  
✔ Zero downtime  
✔ Easy rollback  
✔ Eliminates version conflicts  

#### **Disadvantages:**  
✘ Requires more infrastructure  
✘ Hard to manage for stateful applications

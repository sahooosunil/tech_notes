What is an DevOps?
DevOps is a change in culture and adoption new tools and technologies in fast paced development and fast paced delivery of an software application

Why do we need fast-paced development and fast-paced delivery of an application?
1. The more time directly impacts the cost of development, so the software applications can be used only by enterprise business organizations only and a small or moderate organizations cannot afford to use software in delivering their services to the customer. So the goal is to make software reachable to everyone, this can be achieved through reducing the time required for development/delivery

2. always we should be ahead of the competitors in the market. if the business organization has not adopted faster development/delivery, the competitors would release better products with more features, where the organization looses the business greatly and quickly has to run out from the market

3. with fast-paced development and delivery we can improve the customer ROI (return of investment) which is very important for retaining the customers in the business which will helps to have business growth


How can we achieve fast-paced development and fast-paced delivery of the software applications using devops?
To understand how can develop and delivery the applications quickly, we need to understand how the applications are built in the current model and see what is really taking time and from which we learn what devops is recommending to improve time and delivery fast.

### **Working with Labels and Annotations in Kubernetes**  

#### **Labels**  
Labels are key/value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects to identify and group them. They help in querying and managing resources efficiently.  

- A Kubernetes object can have multiple labels, but each key must be unique within the object.  
- Labels can be added in two ways:  
  1. **In the manifest file** â€“ Assigned at creation.  
  2. **Using `kubectl` CLI** â€“ Added or modified dynamically.  

**Labels can be applied to:**  
- Pods  
- Services  
- Jobs  
- ReplicaSets  
- Deployments  

**Example: Defining Labels in a Pod Spec**  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: roadsterpod
  labels:
    appName: roadster
    version: "1.0"
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: roadster
      image: techsriman/roadster:1.0
      ports:
        - name: roadsterport
          containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

**Useful Commands**  
- View labels:  
  ```sh
  kubectl get pods --show-labels
  ```  
- Query pods by label:  
  ```sh
  kubectl get pods -l key=value
  ```  
- Add a label dynamically:  
  ```sh
  kubectl label pods podName key=value
  ```

#### **Annotations**  
Annotations store non-identifying metadata (e.g., descriptions, licenses, warranties) for Kubernetes objects. Unlike labels, they are not used for selection but provide essential documentation.  

**Example: Defining Annotations in a Pod Spec**  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: roadsterpod
  labels:
    appName: roadster
    version: "1.0"
  annotations:
    license: Apache GNU License 2
    description: "Roadster app for selling bikes online"
spec:
  containers:
    - name: roadster
      image: techsriman/roadster:1.0
      ports:
        - name: roadsterport
          containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

**View annotations of a pod:**  
```sh
kubectl describe pod podName
```

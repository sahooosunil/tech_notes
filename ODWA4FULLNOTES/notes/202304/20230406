vim 
---
vim is an visual editor improved, it is an non-gui editor that is most popular and is being shipped aspart of almost every linux distribution. it is called programmer editor, since it works with commands. 
There are 3 modes are there in vim editor
1. command mode
by default when we open the vim editor, the editor enters into command mode, so that any keypress on the keyboard is considered as a command and performs an operations on the contents of the file. at any point of time we can return back to the command by pressing the esc key on the keyboard

2. input/insert mode
by pressing the "i" key on the keyboard, the editor enters into insert mode, each keypress in the insert mode enters the data onto the file.
	
3. exit mode
once we are dont with editing/modifying the contents of the file we can save and quite the file by entering into exit mode. to enter into exit mode first we need to goback to command mode by pressing esc key, then we need to type : that takes us into exit mode
here we have few options
1. w = save/write the contents
2. q = quit the file (this can be done only after saving/writing the changes)
3. wq = write and quite
4. q! = quit without saving

What are the command available in vim editor under command mode:
1. A = append the data at the end of the line
2. a = append the data to the right side of the cursor position
3. I = insert the data at the begining of the current line
4. i = insert the data in the current cursor position
5. O = open a new line above the current cursor position
6. o = open a new line below the current cursor position
7. r = replace a single character at the current cursor position

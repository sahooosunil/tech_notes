### What is an **EBS Volume**?

EBS stands for **Elastic Block Store**. It is a **block storage service** provided by AWS that is designed to be used with **EC2 instances**. Unlike instance storage (which is temporary), EBS volumes are **persistent**, meaning data is retained even when the EC2 instance is stopped or restarted.

### Why is EBS Needed?

1. **Persistent Storage**: Data is retained even after the instance is stopped.
2. **High Availability and Durability**: EBS volumes are replicated within an Availability Zone.
3. **Flexible Scaling**: You can increase capacity or change volume types without downtime.
4. **Data Backup and Recovery**: You can take snapshots of EBS volumes for backup or disaster recovery.
5. **High Performance**: Suitable for databases, big data analytics, and applications needing low-latency storage.

### Types of EBS Volumes

1. **General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2)**  
   - **gp3**:
     - **Cost-effective** with consistent performance.
     - Baseline performance of **3,000 IOPS** and **125 MB/s** throughput.
     - **Scalable IOPS** and throughput without resizing the volume.
   - **gp2**:
     - Performance linked to volume size.
     - Suitable for boot volumes and general applications.

2. **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1)**
   - High-performance SSD designed for **I/O-intensive applications** (e.g., databases).
   - **Consistent IOPS** up to **256,000**.
   - **io2** offers higher durability and is recommended for mission-critical workloads.

3. **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**
   - High throughput for **sequential workloads**.
   - Suitable for **big data**, **data warehouses**, and **log processing**.

4. **Cold HDD (sc1)**
   - Lowest cost, designed for **infrequently accessed data**.
   - Ideal for **cold data storage** and **archiving**.

5. **Magnetic (Standard) [Legacy]**
   - Previous-generation volume type.
   - Suitable for workloads where **low cost** is a priority over performance.

### How to Configure EBS Volume (Step by Step)

---

### **Step 1: Create an EBS Volume**

1. **Open the EC2 Console**:
   - Go to [AWS EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. **Navigate to Volumes**:
   - In the left panel, under **Elastic Block Store**, select **Volumes**.

3. **Create Volume**:
   - Click **Create Volume**.
   - **Choose Volume Type** (e.g., `gp3`, `io2`, `st1`, etc.).
   - **Specify Size** and **IOPS** (if applicable).
   - **Select Availability Zone** where your EC2 instance is running.
   - Click **Create Volume**.

---

### **Step 2: Attach EBS Volume to EC2 Instance**

1. **Select the Volume**:
   - In the **Volumes** section, select the volume you created.

2. **Attach Volume**:
   - Click **Actions** → **Attach Volume**.
   - Choose the **Instance** to which you want to attach the volume.
   - **Device Name** will be auto-suggested (e.g., `/dev/xvdf`).
   - Click **Attach**.

---

### **Step 3: Connect to EC2 Instance and Mount the Volume**

1. **SSH into the Instance**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i <key.pem> ec2-user@<instance-public-ip>
   ```

2. **List Attached Devices**:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   - You should see the attached volume (e.g., `/dev/xvdf`).

3. **Format the Volume**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
   ```

4. **Create a Mount Point**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/data
   ```

5. **Mount the Volume**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/data
   ```

6. **Change Permissions (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   sudo chown ec2-user:ec2-user /mnt/data
   ```

7. **Verify the Mount**:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Make the Mount Permanent (Optional)**

1. **Edit fstab File**:
   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/fstab
   ```

2. **Add the Following Line**:
   ```
   /dev/xvdf /mnt/data ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2
   ```

3. **Test fstab**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -a
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Take Snapshot (Backup)**

1. **Go to Volumes**:
   - In the EC2 Console, select the volume.

2. **Create Snapshot**:
   - Click **Actions** → **Create Snapshot**.
   - Enter a **Description** and click **Create**.

3. **Restore from Snapshot (Optional)**:
   - Go to **Snapshots** in the console.
   - Select the snapshot and click **Create Volume**.

---

### **Best Practices**

- **Use gp3** for cost-effective general-purpose storage.
- **Use io2** for critical, high-performance workloads.
- **Use st1** for big data and log processing.
- **Use sc1** for cold data and archiving.
- **Enable EBS encryption** for sensitive data.
- **Take regular snapshots** for backups and disaster recovery.

---

### **Example Use Case**

1. You have an EC2 instance running a **MySQL database**.
2. You create a **gp3 EBS volume** of 100 GB for data storage.
3. Attach the volume to the instance.
4. Format and mount the volume as `/mnt/mysql-data`.
5. Configure MySQL to store data in this new mount point.
6. Schedule **daily snapshots** for backups.

---

### **Summary**

- **EBS** provides persistent, high-performance block storage for EC2 instances.
- There are **five types** of EBS volumes: `gp3`, `gp2`, `io2`, `st1`, `sc1`.
- **Steps to configure:**
  1. **Create EBS Volume** in the same Availability Zone as the EC2 instance.
  2. **Attach the Volume** to the instance.
  3. **Format and Mount** the volume on the instance.
  4. **Make the Mount Permanent** by editing `/etc/fstab`.
  5. **Take Snapshots** for backup and recovery.
- **Use Cases** include database storage, application data storage, and log processing.

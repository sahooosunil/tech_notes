suppone you have 20 microservices running. each microservice will have multiple instances. all these instances will be generatiung logs. Usualy these instances running inside containers. if these apps write logs to local file, then once the contaner crash then all the logs will be lost. 
so in microservice we should never write logs to loca files. we should alwasy stream logs to a logging serves like (log stash/splunk)
these logging servers responible for persisting the logs into some location according to configuration. 
these logging server does not have ui where you can view logs. to fetch/search the logs fastly we need to index the files.
we need to configure Elastic search, its a tool which will receive the logs from logstash server and create index files for the origianl file managed by logstash server. Again Elastic search does not have Ui.
to view these logs in ui we have to start another tool called KIBANA.
we can make kibana to call the index fiels getnerated by Elastic search. Kibana has very good web UI wehre we can view the logs.

so how we can configure our microservice to send the log info to logstash/splunk. the elk stack will be maintained by the admin.

### Centralized Logging in Microservices

In a microservices architecture, managing logs is crucial due to the distributed nature of services. Here’s why and how to configure centralized logging effectively:

---

### Problem with Local Log Files

- Each microservice runs multiple instances, often inside containers.
- Writing logs to local files is unreliable because if a container crashes, the logs are lost.
- Hence, it’s best practice to stream logs to a centralized logging server like **Logstash** or **Splunk**.

---

### Centralized Logging Solution

#### Key Components:
1. **Logstash**: Collects and processes logs.
2. **Elasticsearch**: Indexes and stores logs for fast retrieval.
3. **Kibana**: Provides a web UI for visualizing and searching logs.

#### Workflow:
- Microservices send logs to **Logstash**.
- **Logstash** processes the logs and sends them to **Elasticsearch**.
- **Elasticsearch** indexes the logs for efficient searching.
- **Kibana** fetches and displays these logs through a user-friendly interface.

---

### Configuration Steps

#### 1. Set Up ELK Stack
- **Download ELK Components**: Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.
  
**Elasticsearch**:
- Run `elasticsearch.bat` (or equivalent) from the `bin` folder.
- Verify by accessing `http://localhost:9200`, which should return a valid JSON response.
  
**Kibana**:
- In the Kibana configuration file, set `elasticsearch.url: "http://localhost:9200"`.
- Start Kibana with `kibana.bat` and access the UI at `http://localhost:5601`.

**Logstash**:
- Create a `logstash.conf` file with the following content:
  
```plaintext
input {
    tcp {
        port => 5000
        codec => "json" // Logstash listens on this port for logs
    }
}
output {
    elasticsearch {
        hosts => ["localhost"] // Elasticsearch host (change for production)
        index => "micro-%{serviceName}" // Index pattern for Elasticsearch
    }
}
```

- Start Logstash with `logstash.bat -f logstash.conf`.

---

#### 2. Configure Microservice to Send Logs to Logstash

**Dependencies**:
- Add the following dependencies to `pom.xml`:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>net.logstash.logback</groupId>
      <artifactId>logstash-logback-encoder</artifactId>
      <version>6.6</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
      <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.3</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
      <artifactId>logback-core</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.3</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

**Logback Configuration** (`logback.xml`):
- Define two appenders: one for standard output and another for streaming logs to Logstash.

```xml
<configuration>
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread, %X{X-B3-TraceId:-}, %X{X-B3-SpanId:-}] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <appender name="STASH" class="net.logstash.logback.appender.LogstashTcpSocketAppender">
        <destination>localhost:5000</destination>
        <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LoggingEventCompositeJsonEncoder">
            <providers>
                <mdc/>
                <context/>
                <version/>
                <loglevel/>
                <loggername/>
                <pattern>
                    {"serviceName": "booking-service"}
                </pattern>
            </providers>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="info">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
        <appender-ref ref="STASH"/>
    </root>
</configuration>
```

---

### Summary
- **Avoid local file logging** in microservices to prevent log loss during container crashes.
- Stream logs to **Logstash**.
- Use **Elasticsearch** to index logs and **Kibana** for viewing them through a UI.
- Centralized logging simplifies log management, enhances troubleshooting, and scales well with microservices.

### Tracing Requests Across Microservices

In a microservices architecture, a single request often involves multiple services. Distributed tracing helps track the flow of requests, making it easier to debug and optimize the system. Key concepts and tools include:

---

### Key Concepts

1. **Trace ID**:
   - A unique identifier for a single end-to-end request. 
   - It remains constant across all services handling that request.
   - Helps track the entire journey of a request.

2. **Span ID**:
   - A unique identifier for a single unit of work (e.g., a service handling part of the request).
   - Each service or operation in the trace generates a new span with a unique Span ID.
   - Multiple spans collectively form a trace.

3. **Parent-Child Relationship**:
   - Each span may have a parent span (indicating the operation that invoked it).
   - This hierarchy helps visualize the request flow across microservices.

---

### Tools for Distributed Tracing

#### 1. **Spring Cloud Sleuth**:
   - Adds trace and span IDs automatically to logs.
   - Propagates these IDs across microservices via headers.
   - Works seamlessly with logging frameworks.
   
#### 2. **Zipkin**:
   - A distributed tracing system that collects trace data.
   - Provides a UI for visualizing request flows, latencies, and dependencies.
   - Works with Spring Cloud Sleuth to gather and visualize traces.

#### 3. **Jaeger**:
   - An alternative to Zipkin, providing advanced tracing capabilities.

---

### How Tracing Works with Sleuth and Zipkin

1. **Instrumentation**:
   - Sleuth automatically instruments Spring Boot applications, adding trace and span IDs.
   - These IDs are included in logs and propagated with requests between services.

2. **Collecting Traces**:
   - Sleuth sends trace data to Zipkin (or Jaeger).
   - Zipkin collects and aggregates the trace data.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Zipkin UI provides a detailed view of traces, showing the path of requests, latencies, and potential bottlenecks.

---

### Istio’s Approach to Tracing

**Istio** offers a better, code-free solution for distributed tracing:

1. **Envoy Proxy**:
   - Istio uses Envoy as a sidecar proxy for each microservice.
   - Envoy automatically intercepts all network traffic, capturing trace data.

2. **Built-in Tracing**:
   - Istio can automatically generate and propagate trace and span IDs.
   - No need for manual instrumentation or Sleuth in the application code.

3. **Integration with Tracing Tools**:
   - Istio integrates with Zipkin, Jaeger, or other tracing backends.
   - It sends the captured trace data to these systems for storage and visualization.

---

### Benefits of Istio for Tracing

1. **No Code Changes**:
   - Tracing is handled at the infrastructure level, not in application code.
   - Reduces complexity and maintenance in microservices.

2. **Consistent Tracing**:
   - Istio ensures consistent trace propagation across all services.
   - Even non-Spring Boot services benefit from the same tracing setup.

3. **Centralized Management**:
   - All tracing configurations are managed centrally in Istio.
   - Easier to update and maintain tracing policies.

---

### Summary

- **Trace ID** tracks the entire request, while **Span ID** tracks individual operations.
- **Spring Cloud Sleuth** and **Zipkin** provide code-based tracing, suitable for Spring Boot applications.
- **Istio** offers a more seamless, code-free solution with automatic trace propagation via **Envoy** proxies.
- Using Istio simplifies tracing by managing it at the infrastructure level, enhancing observability without modifying application code.

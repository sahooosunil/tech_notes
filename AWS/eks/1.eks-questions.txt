Here are **20 commonly asked AWS EKS interview questions** along with their answers:  

---

### **1. What is Amazon EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
Amazon **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS. It automates tasks like cluster management, scaling, and security.

---

### **2. How does EKS work internally?**  
**Answer:**  
EKS manages the **Kubernetes control plane**, which includes API servers, etcd, and controllers. You only manage worker nodes using **EC2 instances or Fargate**. AWS handles high availability, patching, and updates.

---

### **3. What are the components of an EKS cluster?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Control Plane** (Managed by AWS): API Server, etcd, Controller Manager, Scheduler  
- **Worker Nodes** (EC2/Fargate): Runs Pods  
- **VPC & Networking**: Uses VPC CNI, security groups, IAM roles  
- **Add-ons**: CoreDNS, Kube-Proxy, AWS CNI  

---

### **4. What are the different networking options available in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
- **AWS VPC CNI (Recommended):** Pods get native VPC IPs  
- **Calico:** Supports network policies  
- **Cilium:** Advanced networking with eBPF  

---

### **5. How do you deploy an application on an EKS cluster?**  
**Answer:**  
1. Create a **Deployment YAML** file.  
2. Apply using `kubectl apply -f <deployment.yaml>`.  
3. Expose it via a **Service** or **Ingress**.

---

### **6. What is the difference between EC2 and Fargate in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
| Feature | EC2 Worker Nodes | AWS Fargate |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Node Management | Self-managed | Fully managed |
| Scaling | Manual or AutoScaling | AutoScaling |
| Cost | Pay for instance uptime | Pay per pod usage |

---

### **7. How does IAM authentication work in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
EKS integrates with **IAM roles** for authentication via `aws-auth` ConfigMap. Users assume an IAM role that maps to Kubernetes RBAC.

---

### **8. How do you manage secrets in AWS EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Kubernetes Secrets** (`kubectl create secret ...`)  
- **AWS Secrets Manager** (Use `External Secrets Operator`)  
- **AWS Parameter Store**  

---

### **9. How do you update an EKS cluster?**  
**Answer:**  
1. Upgrade the control plane using AWS Console or CLI (`eksctl upgrade cluster`).  
2. Upgrade worker nodes by updating AMI or replacing nodes with new versions.  
3. Upgrade Kubernetes add-ons (CoreDNS, kube-proxy).  

---

### **10. What is a Cluster Autoscaler in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
The **Cluster Autoscaler** automatically adjusts the number of nodes based on pending pods. It uses **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** to launch or terminate EC2 instances.

---

### **11. How does EKS handle logging and monitoring?**  
**Answer:**  
- **AWS CloudWatch Logs**: Stores logs from control plane and worker nodes.  
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Collects and visualizes metrics.  
- **Fluentd/Fluent Bit**: Sends logs to CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, or Loki.  

---

### **12. How do you implement security in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
- Use **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)** for least privilege.  
- Apply **Network Policies** with Calico or Cilium.  
- Enable **Encryption** using AWS KMS for etcd and Secrets.  

---

### **13. What is the difference between an Ingress and a LoadBalancer Service in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
| Feature | Ingress | LoadBalancer Service |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Purpose | Routes traffic based on paths/hostnames | Exposes a service externally |
| Type | Layer 7 (HTTP/S) | Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) |
| Cost | Less (single ALB/NLB) | More (separate ALBs) |

---

### **14. How do you configure an ALB Ingress Controller in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
1. Install the **AWS Load Balancer Controller**.  
2. Define an **Ingress resource** with path-based or host-based rules.  
3. Apply the YAML using `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`.  

---

### **15. What is an EKS Fargate Profile?**  
**Answer:**  
Fargate Profiles define **which Pods** run on **Fargate** instead of EC2. You specify namespace selectors in the profile.

---

### **16. How do you ensure high availability in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
- Deploy worker nodes across **multiple AZs**.  
- Use **Auto Scaling** to handle failures.  
- Use **multi-cluster setups** for disaster recovery.  

---

### **17. What is IRSA in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
**IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)** allows Kubernetes pods to assume **IAM roles** securely using **OIDC authentication**.

---

### **18. How do you enable Kubernetes Dashboard in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
1. Deploy the Dashboard YAML (`kubectl apply -f dashboard.yaml`).  
2. Get a **bearer token** for authentication.  
3. Use `kubectl proxy` to access the UI.  

---

### **19. How do you troubleshoot networking issues in EKS?**  
**Answer:**  
- Use `kubectl describe pod` to check errors.  
- Verify **security groups and NACLs**.  
- Check **VPC CNI logs** (`kubectl logs aws-node`).  
- Use `tcpdump` and `nslookup` for DNS issues.  

---

### **20. What are EKS Best Practices?**  
**Answer:**  
- Use **EKS Managed Node Groups** for easy upgrades.  
- Implement **RBAC and IAM least privilege**.  
- Enable **Cluster Autoscaler**.  
- Deploy **multi-AZ nodes** for HA.  
- Use **IRSA** for secure AWS access.

**Types of Controllers in Kubernetes**

Kubernetes consists of four major components:
1. **Control Plane (Master Node)**
2. **Worker Node**
3. **Kubectl (CLI Tool)**
4. **etcd (Key-Value Store)**

### **Control Plane Components**
1. **API Server** - Acts as the front-end for the cluster, handling all communication via `kubectl`.
2. **Scheduler** - Identifies suitable worker nodes for scheduling pods.
3. **Controller Manager** - Ensures the cluster always meets the desired state.

### **Types of Controllers**
1. **ReplicaSet**
2. **DeploymentSet**
3. **DaemonSet**
4. **Service**
5. **Job**

### **ReplicaSet Controller**
A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, running one or more containers that share resources like storage, network, etc.

#### **Limitations of Pods**
- Creating individual pod manifests for multiple replicas is inefficient.
- Pods do not restart automatically if they crash.

To overcome these, **ReplicaSet** ensures a specified number of pod replicas are always running.

#### **How ReplicaSet Works**
- Continuously monitors worker nodes.
- If replicas are below the desired count, it requests the Scheduler to create new pods.
- If a pod crashes, a new one is automatically created.

#### **ReplicaSet Specification Example**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: speedreplicaset
  labels:
    env: dev
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      appName: speed
      version: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        appName: speed
        version: 1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: speed
        image: techsriman/speed:1.0
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

### **Managing ReplicaSets**
1. **List ReplicaSets**
   ```sh
   kubectl get rs
   ```
2. **Delete a Pod (ReplicaSet will recreate it)**
   ```sh
   kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
   ```
3. **Scale ReplicaSet**
   - Modify `replicas` in YAML and apply it:
     ```sh
     kubectl replace -f speed-replicaset.yml
     ```
   - Edit directly in Kubernetes:
     ```sh
     kubectl edit rs speedreplicaset
     ```
     (Change `replicas: 2` and save)

ReplicaSet ensures high availability by distributing pods across worker nodes, but it does not guarantee unique node placement for replicas.

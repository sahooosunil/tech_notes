AWS Cloudplatform Architecture
-------------------------------
AWS Architecture refers to how does the cloud platform has been spread across in offerring the cloud/computing services to the world.
  
1. AWS Region
AWS Region is an geographical location within a country from where aws is offering cloud services to the world. AWS Region is not an country, rather within a country they can be multiple aws regions can be there. For eg.. United States country we have #5 regions. AWS Cloudplatform has been spread across 32+ regions around the world.
  
There are 3 reasons why aws has comeup with regions:
1. to avoid network latency in accessing the services
2. based on governance and privacy aspects
3. cost factor

2. Availability Zone
Availability Zones are the datacenters within the AWS region from where it is offering the services. Per each AWS Region, the aws has provided atleast #2 availability zones for high availability. These AZs are choose based on various factors like
1. power availability
2. climatic conditions
3. cyclones/tornados
etc
so the chances of multiple AZs to be failed at the same time is almost zero.
  
3. Edge Locations
Edge Locations are the mini-datacenters co-located around the AWS regions in offerring shared/global services to the customers are the world.
1. Cloud Front
2. Route53
etc

The reason for providing edge location is to reduce the network latency in distributing the services

To access an **S3 bucket** from an **EC2 instance** in a **private subnet** (without public internet access), follow these steps:

---

### **1. Use a VPC Endpoint for S3**
Since your EC2 is in a private subnet, it **does not have direct internet access**. The best way to allow access to S3 is using an **AWS VPC Endpoint**.

#### **Steps to create a VPC Endpoint for S3:**
1. **Go to AWS Console** â†’ **VPC** â†’ **Endpoints**.
2. Click **Create Endpoint**.
3. **Select Service Category:** AWS services.
4. **Choose Service Name:**  
   - Search for `s3`
   - Select **com.amazonaws.<region>.s3**
5. **Choose Your VPC** where your EC2 instance is running.
6. **Select Route Table:**  
   - Choose the route table associated with your **private subnet**.
7. **Select Policy:**  
   - Set it to **Full Access** (or create a custom policy for more security).
8. Click **Create Endpoint**.

### **2. Attach an IAM Role to EC2**
Your EC2 instance needs permissions to access the S3 bucket.

#### **Steps to create and attach an IAM Role:**
1. **Go to AWS IAM Console** â†’ **Roles** â†’ **Create Role**.
2. **Select AWS Service** â†’ Choose **EC2**.
3. **Attach Policies:**
   - Add `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` (or `AmazonS3FullAccess` if write access is needed).
4. **Name the role** and create it.
5. **Attach the role to EC2:**
   - Go to **EC2 Console** â†’ Select your instance.
   - Click **Actions** â†’ **Security** â†’ **Modify IAM Role**.
   - Select the role you just created and attach it.

---

### **3. Test S3 Access from EC2**
Once everything is set up, log in to your EC2 instance and run:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name
```

If configured correctly, you should see the list of objects in the S3 bucket.

---

### **Alternative: Use NAT Gateway (Not Recommended for S3)**
If you already have a **NAT Gateway** set up in a public subnet and your private EC2 instance has a route to it, you can access S3 via the internet. However, this is **not recommended** because:
- **Extra cost**: NAT Gateway charges per GB.
- **Less secure**: Internet traffic can be intercepted.
- **Not needed**: S3 VPC Endpoint provides direct access **without internet**.

---

### **Summary**
âœ… **Best Practice:** Use **VPC Endpoint** for S3.  
âœ… **Security:** Ensure EC2 has the right **IAM role**.  
âœ… **Test Access:** Use `aws s3 ls` to verify connectivity.

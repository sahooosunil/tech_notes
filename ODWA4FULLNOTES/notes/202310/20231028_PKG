Requirement:
1. we need to create a new linux user, bob with default shell, home directory and password
2. configure the user as sudoer with passwordless sudo access


1.
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash bob
sudo passwd bob

2. to configure the user as sudoer we need to add him into /etc/sudoers file as below
bob ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

How can we accomplish the above using playbook?

			
adduser-playbook.yml

- name: add user as sudoer play
  hosts: all
	tasks:
    - name: create user jim
		  user:
        name: jim
				create_home: yes
				shell: /bin/bash
				password: welcome1
			become: yes
		- name: promote user as passwordless sudoer
		  lineinfile:
        path: /etc/sudoers
				line: 'jim ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL'
				insertafter: '^root.*'	
				validate: '/usr/sbin/visudo -csf %s'	
			become: yes

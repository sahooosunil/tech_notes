How to host the static website using apache2 server on ubuntu guest machine?
1. setup an ubuntu virtual machine in oracle virtualbox with 
	1.1 networking mode: NAT 
	1.2 port forward: 80 (host) -> 80 (guest)
easy way to setup the virtual machine with Nat + Port forwarding = use vagrant

2. install apache2 server
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y apache2

apache2 :
1. is an packaged software that is distributed aspart of ubuntu repositories, so we can use apt tool for installing it
2. the apache2 will be configured as initd service by apt tool itself

sudo systemctl status apache2

3. to host the static web applications, we need to copy the website directories into the apache2 server machine under the below directories
/var/www
|-crazyeats (www.crazyeats.com)
|-toyland   (www.toyland.com)

/var = stands for variable large files
/var/www = an standard directory in linux to host static websites

4. write apache2 site configuration files for configuring virtual host configurations

upon installing apache server on ubuntu operating system, it will be installed with default configurations placed under
/etc/apache2
     |-sites-available
		 	|-virtual host configuration files per each site we want to host
		 |-sites-enabled
		 
now we want to host @2 websites so we need to write @2 virtualhost configuration files under /etc/apache2/sites-available

cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
#1	
sudo touch crazyeats.conf
vim crazyeats.conf

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName www.crazyeats.com
	 DocumentRoot /var/www/crazyeats
</VirutalHost>

#2
sudo touch toyland.conf
vim toyland.conf

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName www.toyland.com
	 DocumentRoot /var/www/toyland
</VirutalHost>


5.
we need to enable the sites we have configured above using below commands
sudo a2ensite crazyeats
sudo a2ensite toyland

sudo systemctl daemon-reload apache2

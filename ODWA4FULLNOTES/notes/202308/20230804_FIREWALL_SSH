Firewall
---------
Firewall is used for enforcing traffic restrictions on a computer or a group of computers over the network. using the firewall we can restrict other users/computer of the network to gain access to the programs/softwares that are running on our computer.
	
ubuntu operating system has provided iptables as an firewall software, but working with ip tables is a bit complex. So the ubuntu has provided an utility software called "ufw", which acts as an interface to work with ubuntu iptables firewall
	
ufw stands for "uncomplicated firewall".
	
The iptables and ufw utility is pre-packaged and pre-installed aspart of the ubuntu operating system itself, but by default ufw is disabled. So no network traffic restrictions are applied on the applications that are running on our computer

1. To enable the ufw firewall we need to use
sudo ufw enable

2. To see the status of the firewall
sudo ufw status

3. To see the traffic rules enforced by the firewall
sudo ufw status verbosed

4. when we define a rule in the firewall, per each rule a rule# will be assigned and the rules are applied/enforces based on the order of the rule#
So to see the rule# of the rules we defined in the firewall we need to use
sudo ufw status numbered

5. how to allow/deny network traffic to the programs of a specific portno
sudo ufw allow/deny portno

6. allow or deny network traffic to range of portnos
sudo ufw allow/deny port1:port2/protocol

7. allow/deny traffic from a sourceip address
sudo ufw allow/deny from sourceip

8. allow/deny traffic from a protocol
sudo ufw allow/deny protocol

9. how to delete an rule
we should delete the firewall rule based on rule#
sudo ufw delete rule#

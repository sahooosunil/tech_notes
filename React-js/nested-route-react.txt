Certainly! Hereâ€™s an example of a **parent component** with a `/parent` route that contains multiple child routes, 
using **React Router v6**. The parent route will use the `<Outlet>` to render different child components based on the URL.

### Steps:
1. Install React Router if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

2. Create the necessary components for the parent and child routes.

### Code Example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes, Link, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

// Parent Component
const Parent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Parent Route</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/parent/child1">Child 1</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/parent/child2">Child 2</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/parent/child3">Child 3</Link></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      {/* Outlet where child routes will render */}
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

// Child Components
const Child1 = () => {
  return <div><h2>This is Child 1</h2></div>;
};

const Child2 = () => {
  return <div><h2>This is Child 2</h2></div>;
};

const Child3 = () => {
  return <div><h2>This is Child 3</h2></div>;
};

// App Component
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        {/* Parent Route with multiple child routes */}
        <Route path="/parent" element={<Parent />}>
          <Route path="child1" element={<Child1 />} />
          <Route path="child2" element={<Child2 />} />
          <Route path="child3" element={<Child3 />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Parent Route (`/parent`):**
   - The `Parent` component has an `<Outlet />` where child routes will render.
   - It also includes a navigation menu with links to the child routes (`/parent/child1`, `/parent/child2`, `/parent/child3`).

2. **Child Routes (`/parent/child1`, `/parent/child2`, `/parent/child3`):**
   - These routes will render their respective components (`Child1`, `Child2`, `Child3`) inside the `<Outlet />` in the `Parent` component when the user navigates to each of these routes.

3. **React Router Setup:**
   - The `<Routes>` component defines the routing configuration. The `/parent` route has nested child routes, and each child route gets rendered in the `Outlet` of the `Parent` component.

### Result:
- When you visit `/parent/child1`, it will render the content of `Child1` inside the `Parent` component.
- The same happens for `/parent/child2` and `/parent/child3`.

This setup allows for clean and dynamic routing with nested routes in React.

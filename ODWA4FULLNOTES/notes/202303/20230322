every linux command upon executing generates output , the output generated by an linux command will be written on to the Terminal (STDOUT), similarly every program takes the input from the keyboard/standard input devices (STDIN). if we want our program to write the output to a different destination rather than STDOUT or read the data from an different source other than STDIN then we can use redirection operators < & >
	
> = redirecting the output of a linux command
< = redirecting the input of a program 


echo message > filename = here the output of the echo command will be redirect to the file, so that we can create a file with data inside it.

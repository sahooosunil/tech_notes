The main difference between a **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** and an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** is the **layer at which they operate** in the OSI model and their use cases.

---

### 🏗 **1️⃣ Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
- Works at **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**.
- Routes traffic based on **IP address and TCP/UDP ports**.
- Faster than ALB because it operates at a lower level with less processing.
- Ideal for **high-performance and low-latency applications**.
- Can handle **millions of requests per second**.
- Can load balance **any TCP/UDP-based service** (e.g., HTTPS, MQTT, WebSockets).

📌 **Use Cases:**
- Load balancing **non-HTTP traffic** (e.g., database servers, gaming, VoIP).
- Handling **massive amounts of traffic** (low latency, high throughput).
- **Static IP address** support (useful for firewall rules).

🔧 **Example in Kubernetes (AWS NLB):**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nlb-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: my-app
```

### 🌍 **2️⃣ Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- Works at **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**.
- Routes traffic based on **HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, and hostnames**.
- Supports **advanced routing** (e.g., path-based, host-based routing).
- Can perform **SSL termination** to offload encryption from backend servers.
- Supports **WebSockets** and **gRPC**.

📌 **Use Cases:**
- Routing **HTTP/HTTPS traffic** (web applications, microservices).
- Path-based routing (e.g., `/api` goes to one service, `/frontend` goes to another).
- **Host-based routing** (e.g., `api.example.com` vs. `app.example.com`).
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** support.

🔧 **Example in Kubernetes (AWS ALB):**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-alb-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "alb"
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: "internet-facing"
spec:
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /api
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: api-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

### 🔥 **Key Differences**
| Feature | Network Load Balancer (NLB) | Application Load Balancer (ALB) |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| OSI Layer | **Layer 4 (Transport)** | **Layer 7 (Application)** |
| Protocols | **TCP, UDP** | **HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets, gRPC** |
| Routing | **IP + Port-based** | **Path-based, Host-based, Header-based** |
| Latency | Lower (faster) | Higher (more processing) |
| SSL Termination | ❌ No (passes encrypted traffic) | ✅ Yes (offloads SSL) |
| WebSockets Support | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Best For | **High-performance, non-HTTP traffic** | **Web apps, microservices, API gateways** |

### 🚀 **Which One to Choose?**
✅ **Use ALB if:**
- You need **path-based routing** (e.g., `/api` → service A, `/user` → service B).
- You want **host-based routing** (e.g., `app1.example.com` → service A, `app2.example.com` → service B).
- Your application is **HTTP/HTTPS-based**.

✅ **Use NLB if:**
- You need **low-latency, high-performance** load balancing.
- Your app uses **TCP/UDP** (e.g., real-time gaming, VoIP, databases).
- You need a **static IP address** for firewall rules.

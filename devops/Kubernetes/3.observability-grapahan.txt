User can interact with http server (a component inside Prometheus) to communicate with Prometheus.
User cna use Promql query (Prometheus query language) to get/filter` the output in graph or desired output.
when you install Prometheus by default below thing will be installed along with others
 - node exporters
 - kbestate metrics
 - Graphana

Node exporter exposes as servce one enpoint called /mertrics. Prometheus calls this enpoint to get data related to nodes and store them in time sharing db.
 you can get all the node related data by curl below endpoint in node exporters
 curl node-exporter-service-ip:node-exporter-service-port/metrics.

 same way Kube state mertics exporter also exposes one enpoint called /metrics.Prometheus calls this enpoint to get data related to kubernetes and store them in time sharing db.
 you can get all the kubernetes cluster related data by curl below endpoint in node exporters
 curl kube-state-service-ip:kube-state-service-port/metrics.
 curl kube-state-service-ip:kube-state-service-port/metrics | grep continer //container related data

 what common kuberntes mertics/logs you check in Prometheus regularly?
     - How many time the pod has been crashed?
     - How many secrects are there in your kubernetes cluster?
     - How many users got registered?
     - How many cput/mermory usage in last 24 hours.
     - http requests
Prometheus has basic uI. (it can do scrape the metrics/ it can do graphing / it can do alerts = A completr monitoring tool)
but Graphana has better dashboard.
Graphana is loosly coupled with Prometheus. if you move to some other option instead of Prometheus, there is no effect on Graphana.
Graphana is a visulizaton platform.
Graphana can be integrated with IAM, SSO to handle Authentication and Authorization.
    - for ex: only manager should see the dashboard
    - only devops team can create/update/delte dashboad.
    - Dev/qa team has certain permissions.
Graphana has some predefined graphs out of the box which are useful day to day basis.
 - fox ex: see all pods in default namespace
 - you can add new datasources (like Prometheus (url, port and other details)) in Graphana in Connections tab -> "data source" option

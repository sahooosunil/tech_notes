### **Find the 2nd or 3rd Largest Salary in SQL**  

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Find the 2nd Largest Salary**  
Using `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT`:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```
‚úÖ **How it works?**  
- `ORDER BY salary DESC`: Sorts salaries in descending order.  
- `DISTINCT`: Ensures unique salaries.  
- `OFFSET 1`: Skips the highest salary.  
- `LIMIT 1`: Retrieves only the second-highest salary.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the 3rd Largest Salary**
Modify the `OFFSET` value to **2**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```
‚úÖ This will return the **3rd highest salary**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative Using Subquery**
For **2nd largest salary**:
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM Employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees);
```
For **3rd largest salary**:
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM Employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees));
```

‚úÖ **How it works?**  
- The subquery finds the **highest salary**.  
- The outer query finds the **next highest salary below it**.  
- Nested subqueries allow finding the 3rd highest and so on.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Using `DENSE_RANK()` (Best for Handling Duplicates)**
```sql
SELECT salary 
FROM (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk 
    FROM Employees
) ranked
WHERE rnk = 2;  -- Change to 3 for the 3rd largest salary
```
‚úÖ **Why use `DENSE_RANK()`?**  
- Handles duplicate salaries properly.  
- Ensures correct ranking even when salaries repeat.

---
To find the **1st largest salary**, simply remove the `OFFSET 1`, as we don't need to skip any rows:  
-------
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

‚úÖ **How it works?**  
- `ORDER BY salary DESC`: Sorts salaries from highest to lowest.  
- `DISTINCT`: Ensures unique salaries.  
- `LIMIT 1`: Fetches only the top salary.

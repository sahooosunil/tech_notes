How to restrict access to the sudoers allowing them to perform operations onbehalf of the root?
The sudoers has provided aliases in enforcing restrictions on the sudoers access, there are 4 types of aliases are there
1. User Alias
2. Runas Alias
3. Host Alias
4. Cmnd Alias

1. user alias
if we want a specific list of users to grant sudoers access by enforcing restrictions on them then we can use User_Alias
For eg.. we have joe, bob, greg, jack, we want to promote all of them as sudoers we can achieve this in 3 ways
1.1 /etc/sudoers, make an entry for each user allowing them the sudoer access 
1.2 create a group, associate all the 4 users to one group and make an entry for the group in /etc/sudoers file granting sudo access
1.3 associate all of them to sudo group
1.4 for each user create an file in /etc/sudoers.d directory with sudoer entry individually

1.1, 1.4 = seems to be difficult and duplicated
1.2 = these belongs to different groups, and dont want to create and associate into one group for the sake of sudoer access.
1.3 = we want to restrict sudo access on all of these #4 people, and adding them to sudo group is not adviced

The only way to solve this problem is using User_Alias, create an User_Alias with all the #4 people/users and grant sudo access to the Alias list of people as below
/etc/sudoers

User_Alias ALIAS_NAME=USER1,USER2,USER3
ALIAS_NAME  REMOTE_HOST=RUNAS COMMAND

In the above case we can create User_Alias as below
User_Alias TEAM1_USERS_ALIAS=bob,joe,greg,jack

TEAM1_USERS_ALIAS ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
this means bob, joe, greg, jack has been granted sudo access from any host, on any user/group for executing any command

2. Runas Alias
if we want to allow sudoer to perform operations onbehalf of specific user/group only then we can use Runas_Alias
for e.g.. we want to greg to grant sudoer access and grant him perform sudo operations onbehalf of only joe then we can use Runas_Alias

Runas_Alias DEV_TEAM_ALIAS=joe,jack, %developergroup
greg ALL=DEV_TEAM_ALIAS ALL


3. Host Alias
if we want to grant sudoer access from a specific list of host machines only then use Host_Alias

Host_Alias REMOTE_HOST=192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.11
greg REMOTE_HOST=(ALL:ALL) ALL

4. Cmnd Alias
we want to grant specific list of commands to be allowed to execute under sudo privilige then we can use Cmnd_Alias

Cmnd_Alias PKG_MGR_CMNDS_ALIAS=/sbin/apt, /sbin/dpkg, /bin/tar, /bin/zip, /bin/unzip
greg ALL=(ALL:ALL) PKG_MGR_CMNDS_ALIAS

Passwordless sudo access:

How can bob perform operations using sudo?
1. let the bob login into the machine
2. then open terminal and run the command using sudo command

sudo command args

upon running the sudo command for the first-time after opening the terminal, the linux prompts for bob password as an additional measure of security

but if we obsever he has been already authenticated while logging into the machine. So, it is a bit annoying that linux repeatedly ask for password of bob while running the sudo command, so we can turnoff this password prompt by configuring passwordless sudoers access as below

bob ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Here are **10 key points** about a **Kafka consumer**:  

1. **Consumes Messages from Topics**  
   - A Kafka consumer reads messages from one or more Kafka topics.  

2. **Uses Consumer Groups for Scalability**  
   - Consumers are part of a **consumer group**, and each partition is assigned to only one consumer in a group for parallel processing.  

3. **Offset Management**  
   - Consumers track messages using **offsets** (position in a partition). Offsets can be committed manually or automatically.  

4. **Pull-Based Model**  
   - Kafka consumers **pull** messages from brokers instead of brokers pushing messages, allowing consumers to control the rate of processing.  

5. **Rebalancing**  
   - If a consumer joins or leaves a group, partitions are **rebalanced** among active consumers, ensuring load distribution.  

6. **Auto-Commit vs. Manual Commit**  
   - Consumers can automatically commit offsets (`enable.auto.commit=true`) or manually commit for better control.  

7. **Consumer Lag**  
   - The difference between the latest message offset and the last committed offset. High lag means the consumer is slow.  

8. **Deserialization of Messages**  
   - Consumers deserialize messages from **binary format** (JSON, Avro, etc.), requiring proper **deserializers**.  

9. **Fault Tolerance**  
   - If a consumer fails, another consumer in the group takes over its partitions to ensure high availability.  

10. **Consumer Configuration Options**  
   - Key settings include:  
     - `group.id`: Defines the consumer group.  
     - `auto.offset.reset`: Handles uncommitted offsets (`earliest`, `latest`).  
     - `max.poll.records`: Limits the number of records fetched per poll.

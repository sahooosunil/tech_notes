### AWS Services Every DevOps Engineer Must Know  

1. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**  
   EC2 is like a virtual computer in the cloud. You can use it to run your applications without needing physical hardware. You can choose the size, operating system, and resources like CPU and RAM.  

2. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**  
   VPC is your own private space in AWS where you can securely place your resources, like servers and databases. It's like having your own isolated network on the cloud.  

3. **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**  
   EBS provides hard drive-like storage for your EC2 instances. The data remains even if the EC2 instance is turned off, making it great for applications that need persistent storage.  

4. **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**  
   S3 is used to store files like photos, videos, backups, or documents. It’s secure, durable, and can handle unlimited data.  

5. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**  
   IAM is a tool to manage who can access your AWS resources. You can create users, assign roles, and set permissions to keep everything secure.  

6. **CloudWatch**  
   CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources, like servers or applications. It tracks performance, logs errors, and can alert you if something goes wrong.  

7. **Lambda**  
   Lambda lets you run code without worrying about servers. For example, it can automatically resize uploaded images or process events like new user registrations.  

8. **Cloud Build Services**  
   - **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your applications so you don’t have to do it manually.  
   - **AWS CodeBuild**: Compiles your code and creates the final software package.  
   - **AWS CodeDeploy**: Helps you deploy updates to your application, whether it’s on servers, Lambda, or other environments.  

9. **Configuration (AWS Config)**  
   AWS Config tracks the settings of your AWS resources and alerts you if something changes. This helps ensure compliance with security and organizational rules.  

10. **Billing and Costing**  
   AWS provides tools to monitor how much you are spending. You can analyze usage and set budgets to avoid overspending.  

11. **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**  
   AWS KMS helps encrypt your data by creating and managing cryptographic keys securely. This is essential for protecting sensitive information.  

12. **CloudTrail**  
   CloudTrail logs all actions taken in your AWS account, such as who accessed what and when. It’s useful for auditing and tracking unusual activity.  

13. **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**  
   EKS is a service to run Kubernetes, a tool that manages and deploys containerized applications. AWS handles the Kubernetes setup for you.  

14. **Fargate and ECS (Elastic Container Service)**  
   - **Fargate**: Lets you run containers without managing the underlying servers. It’s fully serverless.  
   - **ECS**: AWS’s container service where you can deploy and manage Docker containers. It requires a bit more setup compared to Fargate.  

15. **ELK (Elastic Stack)**  
   ELK helps collect, process, and visualize logs. Elasticsearch stores the data, Logstash processes it, and Kibana makes it easy to analyze with graphs and dashboards.

### **EKS vs. ECS**  
- **EKS**: A Kubernetes-based solution for advanced container management. It's flexible but more complex to set up.  
- **ECS**: A simpler AWS-native container management service that integrates well with other AWS services. Ideal for basic use cases.

### Config Secrets in Kubernetes  
A **ConfigSecret** in Kubernetes is used to store and manage sensitive information like credentials, SSH keys, and encryption keys. These secrets act as configuration inputs for applications to securely connect to external systems.  

While application configurations can be stored in a **ConfigMap**, this isn't secure because anyone with access to the namespace can view the data. To protect sensitive information, Kubernetes provides **ConfigSecrets**.  

By default, secrets in Kubernetes are stored in **Base64 encoding**, which is not encrypted and can be easily decoded. To enhance security, Kubernetes can integrate with external **Vaults** like **HashiCorp Vault**, ensuring that secrets are encrypted and stored securely.  

### Secret Types in Kubernetes  
Kubernetes provides **seven built-in secret types**:  

1. **Opaque** â€“ Arbitrary data (default if no type is specified).  
2. **kubernetes.io/service-account-token** â€“ System secret for service accounts.  
3. **kubernetes.io/dockercfg** â€“ Serialized format of a Docker config file.  
4. **kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson** â€“ Serialized Docker config in JSON format.  
5. **kubernetes.io/basic-auth** â€“ Stores username and password.  
6. **kubernetes.io/ssh-auth** â€“ Stores SSH keys.  
7. **kubernetes.io/tls** â€“ Stores SSL certificates and encryption keys.  

### Using ConfigSecrets in Kubernetes  
Secrets can be used in three ways:  

1. **As environment variables** â€“ Inject secrets into pods via environment variables.  
2. **As mounted files** â€“ Mount secrets as files in a podâ€™s container.  
3. **For container registry authentication** â€“ Used by Kubernetes to authenticate with a container registry.  

### Example: Creating and Using a ConfigSecret  

#### Creating a Secret (YAML)  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: urotaxidbsecret
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: root
  password: welcome1
```

#### Using the Secret in a Pod (YAML)  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: urotaxipod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: urotaxi
      image: techsriman/urotaxi:1.0
      ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
      env:
        - name: "spring.datasource.username"
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: urotaxidbsecret
              key: username
        - name: "spring.datasource.password"
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: urotaxidbsecret
              key: password
```

This setup ensures credentials are securely stored and accessed by the application without hardcoding them in the deployment files.

### **Mounting a ConfigSecret as a File in a Kubernetes Container**  

Instead of injecting secrets as environment variables, you can mount them as files inside a container. This is useful when applications expect credentials or configuration files to be available in a specific path.

---

### **Steps to Mount a ConfigSecret as a File**  

#### **Step 1: Create a Secret**
Create a Kubernetes Secret that stores sensitive data.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: cm9vdA==   # Base64 encoded "root"
  password: d2VsY29tZTE=   # Base64 encoded "welcome1"
```

> **Note:** Use `echo -n "root" | base64` to generate Base64-encoded values.

---

#### **Step 2: Mount the Secret as a File in a Pod**
Modify the pod specification to mount the secret as a file inside the container.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-demo-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: secret-demo
      image: busybox
      command: [ "sleep", "3600" ]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: secret-volume
          mountPath: "/etc/db-secrets"  # Directory inside the container
          readOnly: true
  volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretName: db-secret  # Refers to the Secret created earlier
```

---

### **How It Works**
- The `db-secret` secret is mounted as files inside `/etc/db-secrets/`.
- Each key in the secret (`username`, `password`) becomes a file under `/etc/db-secrets/`.
- The contents of each file are the decoded values of the Base64-encoded data.

---

### **Accessing the Secret in the Container**
After deploying the pod, you can check the mounted secret inside the container:

```sh
kubectl exec -it secret-demo-pod -- /bin/sh
```

Inside the container, list the files:

```sh
ls /etc/db-secrets/
```

View the contents:

```sh
cat /etc/db-secrets/username
cat /etc/db-secrets/password
```

---

### **Using Secrets in an Application**
Your application can read the secret values from `/etc/db-secrets/username` and `/etc/db-secrets/password` instead of using environment variables.

---

### **Advantages of Mounting Secrets as Files**
âœ… More secure than environment variables (not exposed in `env` command).  
âœ… Can be dynamically updated without restarting the pod.  
âœ… Useful for applications that read configuration from files.

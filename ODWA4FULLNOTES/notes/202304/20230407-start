Packaging
We wanted to send a bunch of files that are there on the Filesystem of our computer to an another user on another computer, the possible ways of sharing these files are
1. use storage devices, copy the files into an pendrive or an external harddisk and carry it physically from one place to another 
2. we can send these files over the email
3. transfer them over the network from one machine to another using scp, ftp etc

the quickest way of sharing the data between the computers is either through email or transfering over the network. If we want to send these files either through email or over the network, since there are bunch of files, sending them over the email or transfering over the network one by one takes lot of time.
	
we can group all theses files into a folder, but unfortunately folders are non-transferrable entities. So to help us in making the folders transferrable the packaging has been introduced.
	
Packaging is a technic of combining multiples files into one single file, so that it can sharable or transferrable easily. The linux has provided an utility called tar using which we can pack and unpack the files


1. How to pack the files using tar?
1.1 tar -cvf filename.tar directory/  = to package directory of contents
1.2 tar -cvf filename.tar file1 file2 file3 = individual files can be packaged into a tar file

tar stands for tape archieve used for packaging bunch of files into a single file with an extension .tar here
1. -c = create
2. -v = verbose = display an output onto the console about which files are you packaging
3. -f = filename to be created while packaging

2. how to unpack the contents of the tar file
tar -xvf filename.tar
the above command extracts the contents of the tar file
-x = extract
-v = verbose, show me the contents you have extracted by writing it as an output to the console
-f = filename to be extracted

3. how to see the contents of the tar file without extracting
for eg..we packaged bunch of files into tar format and distributed to others. how can we see what files are there inside the tar file without extracting

tar -tvf filename.tar
-t = table of contents

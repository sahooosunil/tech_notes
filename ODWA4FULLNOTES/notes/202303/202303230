How to compare the contents of 2 files in linux filesystem?
There are 2 shell commands are available for file comparision
1. cmp
2. diff

1. cmp
cmp stands for compare, cmp compares the contents of 2 given files byte by byte and by default it shows only the first different within those 2 gives files

1.1 cmp file1.txt file2.txt

groceries.txt
dal
channa
rice

grocerieslist.txt
dal
channa
groundnuts

cmp groceries.txt grocerieslist.txt
groceries.txt grocerieslist.txt: byte 12, line 3
	
1.2 -b option shows at what by the difference has been found in the file
cmp -b groceries.txt grocerieslist.txt
groceries.txt grocerieslist.txt: byte 12, line 3 r asciiCode g asciiCode

1.3 -i = ignore the specified number of bytes staring from the top of the file in both files
cmp -i 13 groceries.txt grocerieslist.txt
groceries.txt grocerieslist.txt: byte 1, line 1
	
1.4 -i n1:n2 = ignore starting from the top of the file n1 & n2 number of bytes in both the files
n1 = ignore n1 bytes from first file
n2 = ignore n2 bytes from the second file
and begin comparing the files

cmp -i 5:6 groceries.txt grocerieslist.txt

1.5 -l = list all the difference between both the files
cmp -l groceries.txt grocerieslist.txt
byte position file1byte file2byte

diff stands for difference and it is used for comparing the contents line by line in 2 given files. Along with comparing the contents of the files, it will display recommendations through special symbols indicating how to make the contents of these 2 given inputs files identical

symbol:
1. a = add
2. d = delete
3. c = change
4. > = refers to the contents of the file2
5. < = refers to the contents of the file1

rohit
rahul

team2.txt
virat
dohni
rahul

diff team1.txt team2.txt
3d2
< rohit
delete 3rd line in first line so that from 2nd line onwards both files contents becomes same

1. line number in the first file
2. operation
3. line number of the second file

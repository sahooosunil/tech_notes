File System
File system is a mechanism or a technic used for organizing or managing  to store the data on the harddisk/storage device of the computer. every operating system vendor comes up with their own filesystem technics for efficiently storing the data on the storage device of the computer.
	
Linux FileSystem technics:
1. ext
2. ext2
3. ext3
4. ext4
5. jfs
6. xfs
7. btrfs
by default when we install the linux operating system, if uses the ext4 as an default file system technic in storing/organizing the data on the storage device of the computer. Linux uses Hierarchial File System technic for storing/managing the data

Hierarchial = anything that is represented in parent/child relationship is called "hierarchial" (inverted tree). In hierarchial representations always starts with one root node only.
In case of windows operating system, they dont use hierarchial filesystem technic, so we have multiple roots of storage which are called "drives" in windows file system technics (c:\, d:\, e:\ ...). now the user has to navigate through these drives to locate and use the files that are stored.
	
unlike windows, linux operating system uses hierarchial filesystem, which means there is always only one root of the file system and all the files/folders are stored under the single root only

Linux FileSystem directories:
when we install linux operating system on the computer, it creates an standardized directory structure on the harddisk of the computer organizing the files of the operating system and users.
/(root)
|-/bin   = The linux core commands resides inside this directory like (ls, mv, touch, etc)
|-/boot  = boot loader and boot files are located
|-/dev   = all physical drives are mounted on the /dev directory like usbs, dvds etc
|-/etc   = configuration files pertaning to the installed programs/packages are placed here
|-/home  = per each user of the linux operating system an subdirectory will be created under the /home directory granting the access to only that directory for that user. 
|-/lib   = the shared libraries among the installed software packages are placed under lib directory
|-/media = here the external media devices like dvds, usbs are mounted and will be made accessible from here 
|-/mnt   = the external system / remote storage devices are mounted onto /mnt, in few linux distros even usbs/dvds and other physical devices are mounted onto /mnt
|-/opt   = optional software packages are located here and installed and managed by package managers
|-/proc  = 
|-/root
|-/sbin
|-/tmp
|-/usr
|-/var

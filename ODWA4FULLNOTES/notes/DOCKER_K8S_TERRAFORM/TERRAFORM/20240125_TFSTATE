What is Terraform state file, what is the purpose of it?
When we provision the infrastructure using terraform, it should maintain some sort of mechanism in keeping track of for which resource declarations in the terraform file, 
what corresponding resources are provisioned on the cloud provider platform, so that in subsequent apply of the same terraform configuration, 
it will not recreate the infrastructure.
	
To keep track of the resources being provisioned for the terraform configuration and manage them terraform uses terraform state file. 
The Terraform upon initial provisioning of the resources using the Terraform configuration it creates an state file under the project directory with name terraform.tfstate and an backup file terraform.tfstate.bak

Within this Terraform state file, it keeps track of first each resource declaration what is the corresponding resource that has been provisioned on the cloud platform. 
The terraform queries or takes the id of the resource that has been generated by the cloud platform provider upon provisioning and stores that against the resource declaration in the terraform.tfstate file, 
so that it can manage the infra.

### **Differences Between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript**  

In JavaScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are used for variable declarations, but they behave differently in terms of **scope, hoisting, and mutability**. Let's go over these in detail.

---

## **1. `var`: Function-scoped, Hoisted with Undefined Initialization, Can be Redeclared**

### **Characteristics of `var`**
1. **Function-scoped**  
   - Variables declared with `var` are only accessible within the function in which they are declared.
   - If declared outside a function, they become globally scoped.

2. **Hoisted with `undefined` initialization**  
   - `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with `undefined`, meaning they can be used before their declaration without throwing an error.

3. **Can be redeclared**  
   - The same variable can be declared multiple times using `var`, which can lead to unintended overwrites.

4. **Can be reassigned**  
   - You can update the value of a `var` variable after its initial declaration.

---

### **Example of `var`**
```js
console.log(a); // undefined (due to hoisting)
var a = 10;  
console.log(a); // 10

function example() {
  var x = 5;
  if (true) {
    var x = 10; // Re-declares the same variable
    console.log(x); // 10
  }
  console.log(x); // 10 (since var is function-scoped, not block-scoped)
}

example();
console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined (x is function-scoped)
```
üìå **Key Takeaways**:  
- `var` gets hoisted with `undefined` initialization.  
- `var` is function-scoped, so it is accessible anywhere within a function.  
- `var` does not respect block scope (inside `if`, `for`, `while` blocks).  
- `var` can be redeclared, which may lead to bugs.

---

## **2. `let`: Block-scoped, Hoisted but Not Initialized, Cannot be Redeclared**

### **Characteristics of `let`**
1. **Block-scoped**  
   - Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block `{}` they are defined in.

2. **Hoisted but NOT initialized**  
   - Unlike `var`, `let` is hoisted but remains in a **temporal dead zone (TDZ)** until it is assigned a value.

3. **Cannot be redeclared**  
   - Unlike `var`, `let` cannot be declared again within the same scope.

4. **Can be reassigned**  
   - You can change the value of a `let` variable after declaration.

---

### **Example of `let`**
```js
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 20;
console.log(b); // 20

function example() {
  let y = 5;
  if (true) {
    let y = 10; // This creates a new 'y' variable (block-scoped)
    console.log(y); // 10
  }
  console.log(y); // 5 (original 'y' is not affected)
}

example();
```
üìå **Key Takeaways**:  
- `let` gets hoisted but is **not initialized**, leading to a **ReferenceError** if accessed before declaration.  
- `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible inside the `{}` block it is declared in.  
- `let` **cannot** be redeclared within the same scope, reducing accidental overwrites.  

---

## **3. `const`: Block-scoped, Must be Initialized, Cannot be Reassigned**

### **Characteristics of `const`**
1. **Block-scoped**  
   - Similar to `let`, `const` is also block-scoped.

2. **Must be initialized**  
   - Unlike `var` and `let`, `const` **must be assigned a value at the time of declaration**.

3. **Cannot be reassigned**  
   - Once a `const` variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed.

4. **Objects and Arrays are mutable**  
   - `const` prevents reassignment of the variable itself, but **objects and arrays declared with `const` can still be modified**.

---

### **Example of `const`**
```js
const c = 30;
console.log(c); // 30

c = 40; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const obj = { name: "Hari" };
obj.name = "Krishnan"; // Allowed! Modifying object properties is fine
console.log(obj.name); // "Krishnan"

obj = {}; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable (can't reassign)
```
üìå **Key Takeaways**:  
- `const` **must be assigned a value** when declared.  
- `const` is block-scoped, like `let`.  
- You **cannot reassign** a `const` variable, but **you can modify the properties of objects and arrays**.

## **4. Summary Table**

| Feature      | `var`                           | `let`                        | `const`                       |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Scope**   | Function-scoped               | Block-scoped                | Block-scoped                 |
| **Hoisting**| Hoisted and initialized to `undefined` | Hoisted but **not** initialized (TDZ) | Hoisted but **not** initialized (TDZ) |
| **Redeclaration** | ‚úÖ Allowed               | ‚ùå Not allowed              | ‚ùå Not allowed               |
| **Reassignment** | ‚úÖ Allowed               | ‚úÖ Allowed                  | ‚ùå Not allowed               |
| **Must Initialize?** | ‚ùå No                   | ‚ùå No                        | ‚úÖ Yes                        |
| **Mutable Objects?** | ‚úÖ Yes                | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚úÖ Yes (object properties can change) |

## **5. When to Use `var`, `let`, or `const`?**
‚úÖ **Use `const`** by default for values that don‚Äôt change.  
‚úÖ **Use `let`** if the value will change later (loops, conditions, etc.).  
‚ùå **Avoid `var`**, as it can cause unintended behavior due to function-scoping and hoisting.  

### **Example of Best Practice**
```js
const API_URL = "https://api.example.com"; // Constants (won't change)

let count = 0; // Reassigned later
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  count++;
}

console.log(count); // 5
```

---

### **Conclusion**
- `var` is outdated and should be avoided due to hoisting issues and function scope.
- `let` is useful for variables that change and need block scope.
- `const` is best for variables that should not be reassigned.
